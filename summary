Everything is working perfectly.
I have my the API and the DB
With the API I have tests and logging and an interesting architecture
I will clean the architecture later. For the moment I want to intergrate a gui for the DB.

# db volume
DB gui is a bit weird so I added db volume to never lose the db.
It's working.
